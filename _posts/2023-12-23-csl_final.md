This was my team's final project for 6.8200, Computational Sensorimotor Learning, where we tried to teach a virtual robot to dance.

## Introduction

There are many difficulties associated with designing rewards for certain tasks in robotics and reinforcement learning, particularly for those involving subjectivity and creativity. As reward functions play a significant role on the final learned policy, we wanted to see whether we could design a reward function to incentivize a quadruped robot to "learn" how to dance.

## Methodology

Our goal: given a robot with a trained policy for walking, could we "teach" it to dance and move to a given beat?

- **Observation space**: General dynamics equations of the quadruped (position of CoM, Roll, Pitch, Yaw, joint orientations)
- **Action space**: Scaled torques for 4 hip joints (2 degrees of freedom) and 4 knee joints (1 degree)
- **Learning algorithm**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

### What is "good" dance?

As "good" dance is difficult to objectively define, we aimed to create some criteria to reward to hopefully achieve this:

- Positive reward for variation in joint position, bot speed / acceleration (movement)
- Positive reward for regular intervals between movements (timeliness)
- Negative reward for body / limbs on ground (stability)

## Experimentation

Below are some of the things we tried:

- Rewarding variation

- Penalizing falling

- Rewarding timeliness

- Scaling weights

## Final Output

This was our final result, along with graphs of the robot's velocity and joint positions.

## Final Thoughts

You can see some semblance of dance in the final video, although it is certainly far from perfect. It would've been cool to teach it to sync to input music as well if we had time.
