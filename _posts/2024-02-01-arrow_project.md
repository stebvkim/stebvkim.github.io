I worked on this project with other researchers under Dr. Amar Gupta from 2021-2024. I eventually led the team as a graduate student and wrote my M.Eng. thesis on it.

## Introduction

The goal was to develop an end-to-end automated pipeline for extracting key-value pairs from commercial documents provided by our sponsor, Arrow Electronics.

## Methodology

Our group wrote and published two papers to the International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence on the pipeline. Also attached is my thesis.

Our first paper:
